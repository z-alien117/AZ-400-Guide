# review and input will be conducted soon to ensure accuracy and comprehensiveness


trigger:
- master
# This specifies that the pipeline will be triggered whenever there's a push to the master branch of the repository.

resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: MyPipeline
    source: MyOtherPipeline
    trigger: true
# This section is defining the resources used in the pipeline. In this case, it's defining another pipeline (MyOtherPipeline) as a resource. Whenever the MyOtherPipeline completes, it will trigger this pipeline.

  repositories:
  - repository: MyRepo
    type: git
    name: MyProject/MyRepo
    ref: refs/heads/master
# Here, a repository (MyRepo) is defined as a resource. The pipeline will clone this repository before executing the steps. The ref field specifies the branch to checkout.

  containers:
  - container: MyContainer
    image: mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.1
# This section is defining a container (MyContainer) as a resource with a specific image (mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk:2.1).

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
# This specifies the type of VM to be used for running the pipeline. Here, it's using the latest Ubuntu image.

steps:
- checkout: MyRepo
# This step is checking out the code from the repository defined as MyRepo.

- script: echo Hello, world!
  displayName: 'Run a one-line script'
# This step is running a one-line script that prints "Hello, world!" to the console.

- script: |
    echo Add other tasks here
    dotnet build --configuration Release
  displayName: 'Run a multi-line script'
# This step is running a multi-line script. It's first printing "Add other tasks here" to the console, then building a .NET application in the Release configuration.

- task: Docker@2
  inputs:
    containerRegistry: 'MyDockerHub'
    repository: 'MyRepository'
    command: 'buildAndPush'
    Dockerfile: '**/Dockerfile'
    tags: '$(Build.BuildId)'
# This is a Docker task that builds a Docker image using a Dockerfile in the repository and then pushes that image to a Docker registry. The image is tagged with the build ID.

- task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
  inputs:
    path: $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)
    artifact: 'drop'
